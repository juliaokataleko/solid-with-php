# SOLID - Principles of Object-Oriented Design

Robert C. Martin introduced the ideas in 1995. This was in response to a pattern of issues he saw in OO code.

There was too much dependency happening!

## SIMPTOMS of BAD CODE
### RIGITY
Every change affects many other parts

### FRAGILITY
Things breaks in unrelated places

### IMOBLITY
Cannot reuse code otside of this original context

## SOLID Principles
<ul>
    <li>
        S - Single-responsability principle
        <p>A class should have only one reason to change</p>
        <p>A class should be responsible for a single task</p>
        <p>A class should only depend on one part of the business</p>
    </li>
    <li>O - Open-closed principle</li>
    <li>L - Liskov substituition principle</li>
    <li>I - Interface segregation principle</li>
    <li>D - Dependency Inversion principle</li>
</ul>
